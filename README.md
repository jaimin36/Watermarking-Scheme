# Watermarking-Scheme

These matlab codes implement watermarking scheme by converting a grayscale image to 2x2 matrix and decomposing the matrix by Singular Value Decomposition. There are three different methods by which the watermarking is done. Watermarking an image W to the original image's singular vectors. 

The research papers are as follows:

1. https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0309
2. https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01934

Both images are 256x256 in size and are grayscale images.
